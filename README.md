# Mongo Card Gamer

## You must implement the POST route to add a new game.

1. Fork and clone
2. npm install in both project root and in `client` directory.
3. cd into `seeders` and run `node seedGames.js`
4. Look in App.js to find the `handleSubmit` function. Add your code to call the backend here.
5. Look in server.js to find the route to POST a new card game
